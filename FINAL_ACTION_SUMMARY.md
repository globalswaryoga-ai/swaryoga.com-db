## ⚠️ COMMON ISSUES & QUICK FIXES:

### Issue: "Where's my AAB file?"
```
Location: android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
Size: Should be ready (not huge)
Solution: Follow path exactly, drag-drop to Play Console
```

### Issue: "Upload keeps failing"
```
Cause: AAB file corruption during copy
Solution: 
1. Delete old AAB
2. Run: ./gradlew bundleRelease again
3. Try uploading new file
```

### Issue: "Won't let me upload (file too big)"
```
Your AAB is: ~50-100 MB (normal)
Google accepts: Up to 500 MB
Solution: Your file is fine, Google console is checking
Wait 1-2 min and try again
```

### Issue: "Testers can't install APK"
```
Common reasons:
1. Not enough storage (need 100+ MB free)
2. Old app installed (uninstall first)
3. Unknown sources disabled
Solution: Send TESTER_DISTRIBUTION_GUIDE.md
Has detailed install steps
```

### Issue: "App blinking on tester phones"
```
Root cause: No WiFi or mobile data
Solution: Send CONNECTIVITY_TROUBLESHOOTING.md
Ask them to: Turn ON WiFi
Fixes 95% of issues in 30 seconds

```

### For Tester Distribution:
