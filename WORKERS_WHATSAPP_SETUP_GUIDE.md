## 📱 How It Actually Works with 500 Workers

### **Architecture (Correct):**

```
Meta Verified Business Number (Your Official Number)
    ↓
    ├─ Template Messages ($0.0007 each) ✅
    ├─ WhatsApp Business Account (Free) ✅
    └─ API Gateway (Routes messages)
        ↓
        ├─ Worker 1 (sees/manages on phone) ✅
        ├─ Worker 2 (sees/manages on phone) ✅
        ├─ Worker 3 (sees/manages on phone) ✅
        └─ ... Worker 500 (sees/manages on phone) ✅
```

**Key Point:** Messages still come FROM your verified number, not from workers' personal numbers!

✅ **See chat history** on their phone  
✅ **Get notifications** on personal phone when customer replies
